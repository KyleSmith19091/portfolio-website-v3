                            Hi there ðŸ‘‹
                            I&apos;m Kyle, a computer science nerd.
                            Wrote my first piece of software at the age of 12 on a little Raspberry PI. Still remember (after many, many tries) the little PyGame window that popped up to display the time.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I then embarked on an epic journey, writing magic 8 balls, rocket simulations, text-based adventure games and broken websites (find here: localhost:8080ðŸ˜‚).
                            When I reached high-school, I was introduced to the wonderful world of robotics. This restructured my perception of what is possible with computers and programming.
                            Even though I&apos;ve spent most of my life in the world of software, while watching your program control a physical object (brings a whole new dimension to debugging).
                            My most notable learning was developing a computer vision algorithm for detecting a ball using a phone camera.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            With this wonderful experience behind me I stepped into University, excited to explore the world that I
                            had on merely scratched the surface of: <strong>Computer Science</strong>. My years at university really
                            allowed me to explore and envelop myself into this new world, allowing me to experiment and learn to my
                            heart&apos;s content. It is also at University where I developed a love for researching and exploring
                            the fundamental problems of Computer Science.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            After receiving my bachelor&apos;s degree and honour&apos;s degree I decided to venture into a scary new
                            world: <strong>The Software Industry</strong>.
